#Crowd Behavior Analysis using CNN-LSTM  
**Final Year Project - Computer Science**  

This project detects human behaviors in **crowded environments** using a **CNN-LSTM model**. It analyzes **spatial features (CNN)** and **temporal patterns (LSTM)** to classify behaviors as:  

**Fight Detection**  
**Running**  
**Walking**  
**Crowd Density Calculation**  

##  Features  
 **Deep Learning Model:** Uses **CNN-LSTM** for behavior recognition.  
 **Real-Time Video Processing:** Works with **live feed or pre-recorded videos**.  
 **Multiple Behavior Detection:** Identifies **fighting, running, walking**.  
 **Crowd Density Estimation:** Counts people in a scene.  
 **Trained Model Ready:** Can be re-trained with more data.
